# innoPositioning-Julia

This repository is devoted ot the project related to positioning with a single wireless access point. See [original article for more information](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04173-1_5).

## Computing Wireless Access Point coverage
1. Provide information about walls (format is 4 points for a plane defined in 3d)
2. Provide AP location
3. Provide calibration measurement of actual RSSI values
4. Optimize AP coverage

## Example of indoor AP coverage

## Example of reconstructed path AP coverage 
Actual path in green, reconstructed path in red
